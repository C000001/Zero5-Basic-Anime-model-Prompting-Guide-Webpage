<details open><summary><b>Info</b></summary>
My guide is not an installation guide. Instead, follow this <a href="https://rentry.org/voldy#-guide-">guide</a>.</details>

As for the model, I recommend the [MeinaMix model](https://civitai.com/models/7240/meinamix). For other anime models, I recommend [PastelMix](https://civitai.com/models/5414/pastel-mix-stylized-anime-model-fantasyai), [CetusMix](https://civitai.com/models/6755/cetus-mix), and [AbyssOrangeMix3](https://civitai.com/models/9942/abyssorangemix3-aom3). There are other models, feel free to browse the associated website for them, but I will not detail them in this section. Instead, you can look in [[Model List]].

Be aware that for other models you might need to download a so-called "VAE" as well. If you do not have it, your pictures will look washed out.

To confirm everything is working, generate a picture, with "1girl, masterpiece" as the prompt. Feel free to then play around with the model. If you encounter any errors, re-read the guide, or hit one of the community servers. 

Next: [[2. Setup]]. Read even if experienced.
