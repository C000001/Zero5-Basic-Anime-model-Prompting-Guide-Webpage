### Token Order

The [[1. Fundamentals of Image Generation Models#^488368|tokens]] are processed in batches of 75. The model pays more attention to the first batch, and the first tokens in each batch. 

<details open><summary>
</summary>
Put your complicated, picture-defining things at the start.    
</details>

If the model doesn't pay enough attention to a token, the token can end up getting ignored. The token that gets ignored appears to be random. That's why we want to prevent this. 

Tokens are processed from left to right.

<details open>
Put tokens about the same topic near each other. You can even make paragraphs!
<br><br>
For the ASCII-peeps among us: The new line \n itself should get ignored.
</details> 

This part is so formulaic that I even have a general structure for this:

<details open><summary>
<b>Prompt Structure:
</b></summary>
 <ol type="1">
<li> (Optional:) General description, 
<li> Character(s*)
<li> Character pose
<li> Background
<li> Camera/View
<li> Lightning 
<li> Style (can also be first)
<li> Boilerplate (e.g. masterpiece, best quality, etc.)
<li> Other information (NSFW / SFW)
</ol>
</details>  

Complicated tokens to the front > Complicated groups to the front > Structure 

For multiple characters, check the [[Intermediate Guide]] 


There are many reasons to lightly deviate from the structure. For example, if the pose is complicated, it might be worth it to push it to the front. 

If you want landscape scenes, just skip characters, and add people to the negative prompt. 

The structures don't dramatically change the picture. First, let's make an example for just grouping related words together:

<details open><summary>
<b> Example 1: Girl resting in a cave.
</b></summary>
As an example, instead of: 
<br><br>
<font color=98fb98>
<details open>
<summary><b> Positive Prompt</b></summary>
1girl, blue cave, dim light, comfortable, lying down, smile, crystal, deep eyes, 
</details></font>
<br>
Do:
<font color=98fb98>
<details open><summary>
<b> Positive Prompt
</b></summary>
1girl, lying down, smile, deep eyes,<br> 
blue cave, crystal, dim light, comfortable, </details>
</font>
<br>
  The model might still execute badly. As an example, the blue from the blue cave can bleed into the girl's dress or something like that. Preventing bleed is more detailed in the <a href="INSERTLINKHERE"> Intermediate Guide</a>.<br>
  However, the good prompt is still a lot less confusing to the model. <br>
  <br>
  Here's how the model processes the prompt: <br>
  In the bad prompt, the model goes through the prompt, and on the 8th token knows the overall composition. By that time, the structures for 1girl, blue cave, dim light, and comfortable were already processed. It then is told that there is a crystal, and that the girl is smiling. Almost every token affects a different area. <br>
  In the good prompt, the model goes through the prompt, and on the third token prepares its structures for lying down. That is the composition roughly that it will go for. It then adds details to the girl first, then to the background. The tags affecting the same area apply at roughly the same time. <br>
  
</details>

Now here are three examples where we apply the structure to an existing worse prompt: 

<details open><summary>

We have this prompt from a picture on the MeinaMix gallery:

<p>This is hard to read. First, we are going to add paragraphs and group it. </p>

<font color=EDED96>Background</font> city background <br>
</details> 
<br>
Notice how the layers are all over the place? 
<br>
Let's try grouping it using my format above. 
<br><br>
<details open><summary>

This is much more understandable! The model can understand this better, and so do we! We didn't even fix the tags yet! We'll tackle that in the tags section. <br>

Note:
</b></summary><br>
If you have troubles comparing these, open the links, and swap between the tabs (Firefox: Ctrl + Up / Down arrow). Concentrate on one picture at a time. <br>
Comparison:
<ul>
<li> Some values, like the <font color=EDED96>white shirt</font>, are more represented in our generations compared to theirs. 
<li> The expression itself looks a bit more doll-like (which can be because of the CG token), which we didn't really specify in both prompts. 
<li> The <font color=EDED96>"hair covers ears"</font> prompt was not respected by any generation. 
<li> I'd say that our generations look a bit more cinematic, but honestly there is only a minor improvement; <font color=EDED96>but if you create a batch of a hundred pictures</font>, our prompt will make a number of them closer to the prompt. 
</ul>

Let us try that for two more prompts.

<p>Oof that's kinda all over the place. The person still got a good picture, but I do wonder how many bad pictures it also generated. Especially with this many colour prompts...

</details> 
<p>We can already see a lot of repetitive tags again. Also, the bracket usage is quite hard to adjust. We will detail why and what to do instead in the bracket section. For now, let's just keep it as is.
</p> 
<p>Let's look at the generations again :3
</p> 
<p>First, the old prompt:
</p>
<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017817227245924432/1092429599616540762/grid-0016-3933055293.png">link to pic</a>
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/1A6IED6O6OKRi8o6QX12OS9PwYeArzEGi_NDFfSvc3u7i2Gqk09XKfB3__3aENeutAGA6QtgI5Ma1ulgZIq0fx-clQmDQE3Nhg9bW2ujTEQNMx4-VXkW8IYkQlpgoO_XIXRmMijYMOYol3RW">
<p>Now, the adjusted prompt:
</p>
<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1017817227245924432/1092429617970827345/grid-0017-3933055293.png">link to pic </a>
<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WyU24TdIFzdnT52KWWnGHEIacd1cwj276zcaGEKbQO7WI70qKPVvGZI6mD0JYCEYVsIhfuJ2bL8XRmqJ3leK3IKT6nALr0WSE4I_uTTLujWZ9od3hkasXT0RmAk60-4vfd8ADYnENQokpLjY">
<p>
Overall, our adjusted prompt respects <font color=EDED96>cinematic lightning</font> a lot more. The mouth is also <font color=EDED96>consistently closed</font>. The hair style is relatively consistent, but for some reason ours is <font color=EDED96>completely missing</font> the "beautiful detailed jeweled collar". I'm not sure why, but it might be too far to the back for it to properly add. The other prompts might also steal too much attention from this token. To fix this, I would move both the backpack and the jewelry accessory to the front, and I would adjust the <a href="INSERTLINKHERE">weights</a> appropiately. </p>

<b>Multiple characters are hard. 
</b></summary>
<p>They are an entire section in the <a href"INSERTLINKHERE">Intermediate Guide</a>. I added one prompt, "1girl fights dragon", to generally describe the scene. Otherwise, it would say "1girl, dragon, epic battle" and I think that's too confusing for the machine.  <p>
</details>
<details open>
Mood and emotion certainly can belong to style. More details when we go down to individual tagging. Here, I already anticipated it to be harder to execute, so I pushed it more to the front. 
</details>
<p>I also did some light intermediate prompting for two characters, resulting in this:</p>
<details open><summary>

</b></summary>
<font color=EDED96>General Description\*</font> epic battle, 1girl fights dragon, fire magic, BREAK, <br>

</details> 
<p>Essentially, I added a few BREAK tags to make sure that Character 1 and Character 2 are done in separate batches. That doesn't mean that the batches can't interfere with each other, they almost certainly can, will, and have, but they are much less likely to bleed over unless you want it to bleed over (I will go more in depth in the [[Intermediate Guide]]). For now, just know that it makes character 2 more consistent. 
</p>
<p>Let's look at some pictures :D
</p>

<p>Our adjustments made the "wizard hat" consistently appear. The staff does look better, but that might be more chance than good prompting (weapons, on a non-specialized model or LoRA, are typically hard.) There are more flames, and they look a lot more blazing. Because of the staff, using fire magic with hands is a lot less prevelant. Instead, we see random, staff-like streaks of flames cross the picture. In none of the pictures did the dragon breathe fire. (Might require better tagging / prompting or more images). </p>
<p>The pictures that we made using BREAK have distinctly more dramatic lightning, and a higher chance of there being one dragon. The dragon and the wizard are not necessarily fighting each other (likely caused by inprecise general prompt) but at least the dragon appears more consistently. In none of them does the character look like they won the fight. There also is no fire aura. "victory" as a prompt might just be too ambiguous. </p>
 Overall we noticed these changes:<br>
<ul>
<li> A higher chance that each tag in the prompt is represented
<li> A higher impact of tags than before <br>
And, most importantly:
<li> Much easier to read for humans.
</ul>
If you are trying to edit or improve a prompt, it helps if you only need to pay to one line instead of trying to look everywhere what you already have added and what is still missing. 
</details>

In this section, we dealt with how to structure your prompt. In the next section, we will talk about which tags to use and which ones not.
