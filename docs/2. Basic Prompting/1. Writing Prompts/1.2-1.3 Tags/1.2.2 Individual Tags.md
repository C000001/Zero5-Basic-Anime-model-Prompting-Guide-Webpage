Let us first talk about how to get the most value out of an individual tag. 

<details open> 
Understandable + Clear prompt => Consistent quality output 
Fewer tokens => Better token representation
</details>

However, too few tokens will end up with fewer tags being represented in the final picture. Generally, we are looking to see 75-150 tokens in the positive prompt. 

Because of this, we are looking for tags that contain as much information within as few words as possible. The only exception to this is when we have too much information for one batch. In this case, refer to the [[Intermediate Guide]]. 

 Tips for using individual tags:
<ul> 
<li> Generally, you want to write what you want to see (duh). Don't write what you don't want to see. Especially avoid negatives, e.g. "No hair" is worse than "bald". The model reads hair, and generates hair. The no is fighting against that generation. We do not want hair to have a chance to win. Instead, use "bald".
<li> If you want to focus on a part of the body, or leave out a different part, write more prompts about the part you want to see. The Model will essentially have increased focus in that part. (This is why "face" works, it makes the model focus on the face a bit, which means it is not focusing on e.g. legs)
<li> Words interact alone, and with other words. As an example, if you write "cowboy shot" (a tag for a specific view angle), you will also get cowboy themed stuff like a cowboy hat. "Cowboy" interacts with the model alone, AND "Cowboy Shot" together interact with the model as well. 
<br> Navigating that interaction really is part of the [[Intermediate Guide]], but knowing this earlier on might allow you to troubleshoot unwanted interactions. 
</ul> 

Below, I listed some pretty sensible SFW tags for each section of my prompt structure. They are copied from danbooru. If you are a danbooru user, you will notice that I do not use underscore most of the time. The reason is that sometimes they don't work, and you need to pay attention to your model and to the amount of pictures available. This is covered in detail in the [[Intermediate Guide]].  
For the purpose of the Basic Prompting Guide, we will only sparsingly use actual danbooru tags.

If you want to look up booru tags, I recommend [this site](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/tag_groups) (Links to NSFW stuff).

<b>1. (Optional:) General description: 
</b></summary>
<p>No tags available.</p>
<p>Note: You actually don't want to use tags only for the general description. Instead, write something like "1girl fights against dragon", "2girls holding hands in moonlight", "3girls sitting in cafe".</p> 

<p>You still want to minimize tokens, so cut out the "a", "the", and only add prepositions you know you need. </p>

<p>E.g.: An earlier prompt in this doc which we generated pictures for had "1girl fights dragon", but it often ends up with the girl fighting WITH the dragon, so the preposition AGAINST is needed.</p>

2. Character(s*):
</b></summary>
<p>This section is rather large.</p>
<details open>
<p> If there is a character or a concept that already has tags or concepts built into it, repeating the more general tag is of less use and makes the prompt more volatile. </p>
<p>E.g. "1girl" + "solo" solo is useless, as 1girl already describes only one person. </p>
<p>"catgirl" + "cat tail" can net you multiple tails instead, since it thinks catgirls have cat-tails. 
</p>
<p> If you need to change one of the concepts, you can try (catgirl, fluffy tail), covered in the bracket section below (or better: ((catgirl:0.9), ((tail:0.5), (fluffy:1.2))), covered in the intermediate section). It won't always work, but it has a higher chance of working. If you already use e.g. "tomboy" as a tag, 1girl doesn't add much. This is why we can just use 1girl as a prompt without also having to prompt arms, legs, and more. "1girl" already covers that.</p>

3. Background
</b></summary>
<p>Here, dumping details is actually pretty ok to make a picture appear more natural (as long as not every detail is important). For example, most bedrooms have a form of light in there, but anime generated pictures do not necessarily have them. Adding "lamp, lights, lights on, windows," relatively late into the prompt can help the model add details to make it seem realistic.</p>
<p>If you are stumped for details, you can ask ChatGPT, or look up pictures on the internet, then name what you see then throw it into CLIP or DeepBooru in the img2img tab. Alternatively, you can just leave it up to the model, but it's kinda random what you get. I actually know a lot less about this; if someone has extensive experience with background / landscape prompting, I'm very interested to hear your thoughts. </p>
<p>Here's a list of basic backgrounds and some objects they might have (do start with e.g. background, forest):</p><p>
[colour] background, simple background, </p><p>
<font color=F1ACAB>City street / city background:</font></p><p>
[insert name of city], crowd, [adjective] streets, traffic lights, pylon, skyscraper, trains, cars, trucks, bridges, trees, </p><p>
<font color=F1ACAB>Living room:</font></p><p>
fireplace, couch, lamp, wood, chair, table, book shelves, rug, windows, door window, potted plants, ornament shelves, plate shelves, XX era,</p><p>
<font color=F1ACAB>Forest:</font></p><p>
trees, bamboo, grass, hills, valley, spring, summer, autumn, winter, snow, ice, rain, dew, river, stream, lake, pond, wildlife, [animal], </p><p>
Some more sceneries: cave, cyberpunk, machinery, abstract, bedroom, office, fantasy, </p><p>
