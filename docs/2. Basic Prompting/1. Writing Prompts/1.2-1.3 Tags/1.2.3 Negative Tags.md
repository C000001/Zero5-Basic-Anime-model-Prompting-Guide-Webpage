To put it bluntly, use negative tags to fight against positive tags. 

The best case scenario is when our prompt is not fighting itself. This is not always possible. In these worse scenarios, you can use other positive tags or negative tags to fight against them. 

They are also the place where negative text embeddings should be prompted. More on that in the  [[4.1 Textural Embeddings or Textural Inversions]] part. 

This is the negative tags I used for SFW pictures. It's old, but it covers most general case scenarios. 

<details open><summary>
<b><font 
color=F1ACAB>Negative Prompt:

</b></summary>
<p>(worst quality, bad quality, normal quality:1.2), nsfw</p><p>
bad anatomy, bad proportions, </p><p>
bad body, </p><p>

signature, text, too many fingers, username, watermark, </p><p>
(bad_prompt_version2:0.4),  (easynegative:0.6)</p><p>
</details>

Nowadays, I instead start with this prompt: 

<details open><summary>
<b><font 
color=F1ACAB> Negative Prompt:
</font>
</b></summary>
<p>(worst quality, bad quality:1.3), </p>
</details>

And then I add things to it based on the output I get. More on that in the section [[2. Improving an existing picture|Improving an existing picture]], specifically [[2.1 Creating variations|Prompt refining]].

The first prompt is perfectly fine though! It is also what I recommend you to use! Negative prompts do not have as much impact on the final picture as the positive prompt.\* 

Next: [[1.3 Token bleed and Token fighting|Token bleed and Token fighting]].

*If the negative prompt hugely impacts the model, and if you are using the Model Anythingv4 / v4.5: Set the target resolution to 512x512, as it sucks at anything else. If it's something else, then head over to <a href="INSERTLINHERE">4.1 Textural Embeddings or Textural Inversions</a>, or the <a href="INSERTLINKHERE">Intermediate Guide</a>.
