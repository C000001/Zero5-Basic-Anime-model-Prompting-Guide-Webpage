<font color=F1ACAB>Light, glow:</font>
backlighting (light from behind character, e.g. blinds, looks really good for dramatic scenes),
bloom (makes glow glow more), 
diffraction spikes (single point light spike, e.g. twinkling star that shines brighter),
lens flare,
tyndall effect (light scatters around), 
light rays,
ray tracing (makes rays more prominent, and does some other stuff that resembles the ray tracing effect), 
god rays (the light that appears when something divine happens),
dappled light (round lights that peek through e.g. foliage of the forest), 
light glare,  
overexposure (brighter image), 
reflection, 
caustics (water light reflection),
refraction (think of a prism breaking light), 
hard light (light stands out from shadow harder),
warm glow, 
glowing white particles, 

<b><font color=F1ACAB>shadow:</font>
</b>
hdr (make dark things darker, bright things brighter, contrasting light and shadow, typically creates light in middle darkness outside),
shadow, 
dropshadow (character shadow is thrown hard onto wall),
vignette (outside dark inside bright),

<font color=F1ACAB>focus:</font>
bokeh (things out of focus e.g. background / edge of image get more blurry),
depth of field (certain layers become blurry),
blurry foreground,
blurry, 
blending (obj blends into BG, bleeding seems to get closer and blending doesn't seem to work at all, likely because of [[1.3 Token bleed and Token fighting|Token bleed]]),

<font color=F1ACAB>Misc:</font>
chiaroscuro (red-blue colour contrast for 3D volume),
chromatic aberration (motion somewhat, also lens, a bit more "real"), (I need to check if I maybe swapped out the two I don't have internet rn)
emphasis lines (anime emphasis) / motion lines,
double exposure (layer one image inside the other image, MeinaMix CANNOT do this, better to get the LoCan on Civit / the LoRA if such a LoRA is out),
For even darker shadows, see the [[Intermediate Guide]]
