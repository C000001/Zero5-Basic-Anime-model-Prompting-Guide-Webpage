<font color=F1ACAB>emotional faces</font>: 
angry, annoyed, blush, bored, closed eyes, crazy, disappointed, disgust, despair, expressionless, flustered, grimace, winking (unreliable), pout <(Don't use pout, use :< instead. It just looks wrong idk what's going on here), sad, tears, scared, sigh, surprised, upset, smile, grin, smug, 

<font color=F1ACAB>emotes:</font> 
:o, :3, uwu, owo, o_o, :< and some other emotes work. They need to be recognized text emotes. Yes, someone looked at a picture and annotated it with uwu. Other emotes don't work. Just experiment with it.

<font color=F1ACAB>Also</font>:
tongue, tongue out, 

If you are looking to get a different face from the usual faces, I recommend using names and random characters for more variation. This is further covered in the [[Intermediate Guide]].
