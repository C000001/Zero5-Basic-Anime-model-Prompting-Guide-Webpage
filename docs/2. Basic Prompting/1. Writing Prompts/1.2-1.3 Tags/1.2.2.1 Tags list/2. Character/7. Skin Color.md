Skin Color:
dark skin, pale skin, tan, \[color\] skin also works. 

(If you are trying to generate people of colour, there's a separate guide below in the [[Intermediate Guide]]. Anime very obviously just doesn't have a lot of people of colour images. It's still possible though, and much easier if you use a more diverse model like MothMix or a LoRA instead.)
