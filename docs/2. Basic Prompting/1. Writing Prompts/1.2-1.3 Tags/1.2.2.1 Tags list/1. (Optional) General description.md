This is the part that most resembles standard prompting. You write a short descriptive phrase to give an overview to the model. 
Write something like "1girl fights against dragon", "2girls holding hands in moonlight", "three girls sitting in cafe".
You still want to minimize tokens, so cut out the "a", "the", and only add prepositions you know you need. 
E.g.: An earlier prompt in this doc which we improved on "1girl fights dragon", but it often ends up with the girl fighting WITH the dragon, so the preposition AGAINST is needed.
