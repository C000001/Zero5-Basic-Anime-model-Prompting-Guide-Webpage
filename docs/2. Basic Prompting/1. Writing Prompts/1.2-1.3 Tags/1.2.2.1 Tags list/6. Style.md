If you know an anime show that you like, or artists that you like, or if it's even a decade of Anime done in that style, I recommend that you try to type that in, or look around if there is a LoRA or even a model done for that style. More details in the LoRA section, basically, if I personally want a style, I'm looking for the right model and LoRA combination to get it generally, instead of typing in shows the model might not even be trained on.
