If you know an anime show that you like, or artists that you like, or if it's even a decade of Anime done in that style, I recommend that you try to type that in, or look around if there is a LoRA or even a model done for that style. More details in the LoRA section, basically, if I personally want a style, I'm looking for the right model and LoRA combination to get it generally, instead of typing in shows the model might not even be trained on.

<font color=F1ACAB>Colors:</font> <font color="98fb98">Keep US spelling</font>
impasto (very colourful), vivid colors, limited palette, pastel colors, monochrome, duochrome,  RAW (doesn't work that well, instead use the following two:), brutal, grotesque (Both prompts need an actual prompt for context or it suffers from token bleed)

<font color=F1ACAB>Lines:</font>
lineart, sketch, rough sketch, outline, pixel art, greyscale, 3D render, octane render, CG, Unreal Engine, CGStation, (for these, get a [[4.2 LoRAs|LoRA]]:) thick outline, white outline, calligraphy_brush, color trace, 

<font color=F1ACAB>Format:</font>
illustration, portrait, cover, wallpaper, 
Realism: DSLR photo, the lens of the camera (e.g. 200mm, 21mm, works less well on anime models but can still work)

<font color=F1ACAB>Anime vs Real Style: </font>
realism, painterly, pastel, anime, 

<font color=F1ACAB>Other:</font>
\[Setting\], \[Country\], \[epoch\], traditional/modern, \[image style\], \[artist\], \[show\],
\[Setting\] might even be worth pushing to the front.
Meina is not super flexible with painting styles, because it's mostly trained on anime images. You can grab different models for different styles, as well as LoRAs.
