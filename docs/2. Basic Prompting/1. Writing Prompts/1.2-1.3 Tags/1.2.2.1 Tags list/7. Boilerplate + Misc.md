extremely detailed,  <font color=98fb98>same as (intrinsically detailed:1.5)</font>
masterpiece, best quality <font color=98fb98>(does little, but is not intrusive and generally makes it sliiiightly better). The closer to older models you are, the more likely you should put this at the end of your prompt.</font>
4k <font color=98fb98>(realism, can help structure it in a sharper / more powerful way), </font>

<font color=F1ACAB>Hair, Face, chest, belly, thigh, legs feet, </font> <font color=98fb98>(add at end of character to control what the picture views)</font>
<font color=98fb98>There is no boilerplate that helps with hands. As far as I know.</font> 
<font color=EDED96>Deep eyes,</font> <font color=98fb98>(makes it so eyes get slightly more focus)</font>
