CFG controls how much the model "sticks" to your prompt. 

Most of the time, you are fine just leaving it at 7. Some models perform better with lower CFG, some with higher CFG. I typically just open the CivitAI site of the model and look at the image prompts. If they are meaningfully higher orlower than 7, I adjust them into that direction, from 5 CFG to 11 CFG.

At higher CFG you will eventually get a burnt image. There are [[Extensions]] to mitigate that.
