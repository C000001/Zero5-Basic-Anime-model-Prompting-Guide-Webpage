What a Sampler does doesn't matter for the Basic guide. That is tackled in the [[Intermediate Guide]]. No, what matters for us is which Sampler to use.
The relevant Samplers for us are:
- DPM++ 2M Karras
- Euler A
- DDIM
- UniPC
- DPM++ SDE Karras
- DPM++ Karras

You can set your Sampler and your Sampling Steps here. I will give a range, I myself use the higher end, since regenerating a picture if it's too low steps and doesn't have enough details takes too much time for me. 
The way I decide a Sampler is: I check the reviews under the model, and look at what sampler they use. If I use the model more, I will try DPM++ 2M Karras, DDIM and UniPC either way.
