The ideal output is 512x512. This is what most models were trained with. You can deviate from that, but some models <font color=98fb98>*cough Anythingv4.5 and all mixes with it in it cough*</font> don't like it at all. You still want to have at least one of the resolutions be a multiple of 64, and you also want to keep it beneath 1000px on both sides, as the model will start thinking there are TWO pictures instead and generate fun stuff like two heads or two girls.

Thanks to Winston Woof for calculating everything out!
