I did more research, commas do seem to impact the image heavily. I will launch a few more researches later, but it seems like a topic to cover in the [[Intermediate Guide]]


Outdated+maybe wrong for 1x+ series NVIDIA GPUs? I'm really getting confused by the GPUs:
<font 
color=F1ACAB><h2>Commas do not majorly impact the image. </h2></font>
Most beginners think they do, but they don't. They slightly help with separation, and that's it. 

Okay, this warrants an explanation. Let's look at the following prompt:

Need to generate all, bruh, I'll do that when I get better GPU

I did a test on "black, cat, girl" or something like that and then on "black cat girl" and inbetween and the results did change but not majorly so, so in no result was there a cat, but might be samplesize low
I recently read that it helps break tokens up since it actually can't consume sentences that long
Needs more testing
