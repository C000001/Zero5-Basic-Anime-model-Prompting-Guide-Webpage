CFG controls how much the model "sticks" to your prompt. 

Most of the time, you are fine just leaving it at 7. Some models perform better with lower CFG, some with higher CFG. I typically just open the CivitAI site of the model and look at the image prompts. If they are meaningfully higher orlower than 7, I adjust them into that direction, from 5 CFG to 11 CFG.

If you are working with a model over a longer period of time, it can be worth experimenting what its preferred CFGs are. You may find yourself some prompts actually working better with a lower CFG, and some prompts warranting a higher CFG. 

This is the rough feeling I have from it, which I cannot really prove unfortunately:

At higher CFG, it will repeat patterns. As an example, when prompting for fingers, it may prompt many fingers or fingernails. 
At low CFG, it will try to rely more on the overall picture. As an example, when prompting for fingers, it will try to generate pictures where fingers are prominent. But because the structures are missing, the fingers often look melted or misshapen.  

At super high CFG your image will get burnt. There are [[4.3 Extensions|Extensions]]to mitigate that.
