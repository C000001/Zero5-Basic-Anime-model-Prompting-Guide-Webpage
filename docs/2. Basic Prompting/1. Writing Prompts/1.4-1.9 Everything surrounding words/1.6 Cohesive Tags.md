Sometimes, you want tags to be realized as a group. For that, you can take a look at [danbooru]([Danbooru: Anime Image Board (donmai.us)](https://danbooru.donmai.us/)) if they have it, and the amount of images with that tag is over 800. 

Alternatively, you can use brackets. Brackets not only adjust weights, but also group the tags slightly together. I recommend not using more than 5 words inside a bracket if you want this effect. [[CLIP]] might otherwise just ignore it. 

You can also try writing the words together or writing a + instead of a spacebar. This forces CLIP to process them together instead of trying to process them separately. This method has worse results if the word combination is somewhat frequent, as then it will process them individually together, instead of the actual word combination. 

As an example, "red eyes" is a common combination, so switching to red+eyes / redeyes would be worse. However, "lizard keyboard" is more uncommon, and might get processed separately instead, so switching to "lizardkeyboard"/"lizard+keyboard" is better.

CLIP will try to understand typos, but you will likely get different results anyway.
