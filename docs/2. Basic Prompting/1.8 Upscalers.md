Upscaling for <font color=EDED96>text2img</font>:

We want to mainly upscale this way because the model essentially adds details while upscaling. It will improve the details, especially for faces and hands. 

Here's how:
![[Pasted image 20230416231425.png]]

1: Enable Hires. Fix.
This way you use the upscaler. If you do not have this enabled, it won't upscale.

2: Do not use the Latent Upscaler. Use the ESRGAN ESRGAN anime Upscaler, or use one of the upscalers from [Model Database - Upscale Wiki](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database). <font color=98fb98>Especially Anifilm for anime and Lollypop for 2.5D. I also heard good stuff about Remacri and UltraSharp. I cannot test because bad GPU, so this is community advice.</font>

3: You can click on the greyed out boxes for an individual resolution. I recommend sticking to established resolutions, but if you need to set your own, make sure at least they are multiples of 64. Also, from what I heard, you can have the output resolution to 512x512 then upscale to a different aspect ratio. I still need to verify this myself. 

4: Set denoising to 0.2 for smaller changes, 0.3 for a bit more bigger changes. If you are using Latent Upscaler, you need to use 0.5 or more, or it will look blurry. Denoising adds noise to the picture so that the model can use the noise and the original picture to increase the resolution. 

5: You can leave it at 0. 0 means that you do the same amount of steps as you had set for your sampler. If you have low VRAM, consider increasing the amount of steps, as then the VRAM spike at the start and at the end gets lower. 

Consider also using this [[Extensions|Extension]] for less VRAM intensive Upscaling.
