In chapter 1, we used Prompt Engineering to generate consistent quality pictures. Already starting from [[1.3 Token bleed and Token fighting]], we dealt a bit more with how to increase the quality. 

And then perhaps you generated a hundred, and found one or two that you liked, were it not for a missing tag, a tag that is not prominent enough, bad face, bad hands, artifacts, or some other minor detail in the picture.  

Or maybe you did find a different picture elsewhere that you want to change. 

This is what this chapter is about â€” Making one singular picture better.

Next: [[2.1 Creating variations]]
