In chapter 1, we used Prompt Engineering to generate consistent quality pictures. Starting from [[1.3 Token bleed and Token fighting]], we dealt a bit more with how to increase the quality. 

In the process, you perhaps generated a hundred, maybe even a thousand or more pictures, and found one or two that you liked, were it not for some imperfections; a missing tag, an underrepresented tag, bad face, bad hands, artifacts, or some other minor detail in the picture.  

Or maybe you did find a different picture elsewhere that you want to change. 

It makes no sense that we throw away a perfectly fine picture with slight imperfections. 

This is what this chapter is about â€” Making a singular picture better.

Next: [[2.1 Creating variations]]
