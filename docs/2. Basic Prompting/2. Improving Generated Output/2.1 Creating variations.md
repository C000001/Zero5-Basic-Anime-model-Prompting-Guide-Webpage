Prompt refining is useful when you have a picture that you like, but want to use a light variation of it. This is similar to MidJourney's Variation option, with the key difference that you are in control of the variations. 

Firstly, we want to lock down the seed. 
If you just generated the picture, then click this button to grab the seed:
![[Pasted image 20230419173538.png]]
Otherwise you will need to look at [[PNG Info|png info]] or at the file name, and manually enter the seed. 

Now, there are multiple options, depending on your wants and needs:
Repair artifacts => <font color="EDED96">Increase Sampler Steps or adjust negative prompt</font>
Respect / Disrespect prompt slightly more => <font color="EDED96">Adjust CFG or adjust weight</font> 
Introduce slight variations => <font color="EDED96">Adjust prompt</font>
Introduce new objects / new style => <font color="EDED96">Adjust prompt, weight, or go to</font> [[2.2 Img2Img]]

## Repairing artifacts
Artifacts typically happen as a result of low sample steps. Simply increasing it can help you here. If your sampler steps are already beyond 40, then reducing it down to 40 can also fix some artifacts with some models.
