Prompt refining is useful when you have a generated picture that you like, but want to use a light variation of it. This is similar to MidJourney's Variation option, with the key difference that you are in control of the variations. 

Firstly, we want to lock down the seed. 
If you just generated the picture, then click this button to grab the seed:
![[Pasted image 20230419173538.png]]
Otherwise you will need to look at [[PNG Info|png info]] or at the file name, and manually enter the seed. 

Now, there are multiple options, depending on your wants and needs:
Repair artifacts => <font color="EDED96">Increase Sampler Steps or adjust negative prompt</font>
Respect / Disrespect prompt slightly more => <font color="EDED96">Adjust CFG or adjust weight</font> 
Introduce slight variations in MidJourney style => <font color="EDED96">Adjust prompt, or use the <a href="">Variation</a> (Intermediate Guide)</font>

## Repairing artifacts

Artifacts typically happen as a result of low sample steps. Simply increasing it can help you here. If your sampler steps are already beyond 80, then reducing it down to 40 can also fix some artifacts with some models. 

Alternatively, you can add these tags to your negative prompt:

>[!failure] Negative prompt:
>jpeg artifacts, aliasing, error, moire,  

Furthermore these might be useful:

>[!failure] Negative prompt:
>cropped, multi view, poorly drawn, anatomical nonsense, bad anatomy, bad feet, bad hands, bad proportions, bad quality, extra digits, extra limbs, missing digits, missing limbs

If these methods are too much effort or change the picture too much, you can also look at [[2.2 Img2Img]] to fix it. 

## Respect / Disrespect prompt slightly more

If it's only a few individual tags that need to be adjusted, you can try increasing/decreasing the weight of it. You can also try decreasing/increasing the other weights in the surrounding area, that are either not as important to you, or just are getting overrepresented. 

As an example, you might want red hair, but the red also bleeds into the eyes and the background, despite prompting e.g. blue eyes. In this case, lower the weight of red, and increase the weight of the blue. 
red hair, blue eyes => (red:0.7) hair, (blue:1.15) eyes

For CFG tuning, refer to [[1.6 Adjusting CFG]].

## Introduce slight variations

Very slightly different: 
Add random garbled words at the end, e.g. "AHtalIth" or "dashioeth". CLIP processes it and adds something random. You can adjust the prompt and weight. 

Slightly different: 
Use the [[Variation Feature]]. 

## It doesn't work.
If the above method doesn't work, it's about time we use different methods.
