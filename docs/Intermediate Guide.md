Coming to you SoonTM.



BREAK introduction
There are two scenarios where fewer tokens get you worse pictures. 
The first one is obviously when you want to include a hundred different things, and are fine with leaving out some. 
The second scenario is complicated tags. If the tags themselves contain too much information or are too much to paint, separating them into different batches is the way to go.
