Hello everyone o//

The goal of this guide is to teach you how to prompt better. 
Better prompts generate [[1. Good vs Bad prompt results |lower failure outputs]] and allow the model to [[2. simple vs complex vs messy prompts |handle more complex prompts better]]. A bad prompt might still result in a good image every hundred images, but a good prompt will do so more consistently, allowing you to discard less images. 

If you are just trying the technology out, you can just prompt yourself or copy any random prompt and get okay enough outputs. Refer to [[Prompting for Dummies|Prompting for Dummies]].

This guide is for people who:
1. Want a basic idea of prompting anime models (base: [[Stable Diffusion 1.5 | Stable Diffusion 1.5]] / [[Novel AI or NAI|Novel AI]])
2. Want to have high quality pictures more often
3. Need to generate something complex and don't know how
4. Want to keep power consumption low by generating fewer pictures
5. Are interested in prompt engineering

>[!warning] Warning:
>This guide applies mostly to anime models. Photorealistic models do not work the same way. Read a photorealistic guide instead, if there is one. If not: Some concepts <i>do</i> carry over, so don't worry. Refer to the <a href="INSERTLINKHERE">general information list</a>. 
>Also: The guide is based on what I read and what I experimented with. I do not guarantee the validity of the guide. Please don't trust the guide, run your own experiments. 

>[!note]+ Note: This guide is SFW. 
I want the most people to benefit from this guide. Jumping from SFW to NSFW prompts is easier than from NSFW to SFW, and has the added benefit that you can read this hopefully without triggering some sensors at your workplace.

First off, we want to start with installing the [[1. Installing Automatic1111 WebUI |Automatic1111 WebUI ]]. 
Then, we want to make sure we have the right [[2.1 Save Prompt and Generation Information To File|Setup]]. Even experienced users should take a quick look at this section, I have a [[2. Setup|list]] at the start. 
Then we can already get started with [[1. Fundamentals of Image Generation Models|Basic Prompting]]
